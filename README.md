# DataStructureProjects
This repository contains implementations of four projects for the COMP2421 course. The projects cover various data structures and algorithms.

## Project 1: Large Integer Calculator
### Description:
This project involves implementing a calculator for performing arithmetic on very large integers using doubly linked lists. The supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication (standard multiplication algorithm), and division (long division algorithm).

### Features:
- Reads input numbers from a file.
- Supports arithmetic operations on large integers.
- Uses a doubly linked list for efficient traversal.
- Outputs results to a file.
- Provides a user-friendly menu for operations.

## Project 2: Infix Calculator with Validity Check
### Description:
This project involves implementing a calculator that reads a file containing mathematical equations written in infix notation. The program checks the validity of each equation, converts valid expressions to prefix notation, evaluates them, and saves the results.

### Features:
- Reads input equations from a file.
- Checks for equation validity (e.g., balanced parentheses, proper operator usage).
- Converts valid infix expressions to prefix notation.
- Evaluates prefix expressions.
- Outputs valid and invalid equations to a file.

## Project 3: Student Information Management using BST
### Description:
This project involves implementing a student management system using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The system allows insertion, deletion, searching, and listing of students based on various attributes.

### Features:
- Insert a student with details (ID, name, address, class ID, date of enrollment).
- Search for a student by ID and update information if found.
- List all students in lexicographic order.
- Search for students by city and class.
- Delete a student by ID.
- Save and load student data from `students.data`.
- Interactive user menu.

## Project 4: Shortest Path Finder (Dijkstra & BFS)
### Description:
This project involves implementing Dijkstra's and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms to find the shortest path between two cities. The program reads city data from a file and constructs a graph.

### Features:
- Reads city data from `cities.txt` and constructs a graph.
- Allows the user to input source and destination cities.
- Computes and prints the shortest path using both Dijkstra’s and BFS algorithms.
- Displays distances for Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- Saves results to `shortest_distance.txt` before exiting.
